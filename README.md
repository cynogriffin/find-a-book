# Find-a-Book

This project was a refactoring of an existing codebase that was using a RESTful API to work with the backend. The goal was to convert the application to use a GraphQL backend. The application itself is a book search application that lets the user search books by title or topic and get the cover images as well as a summary of the books. Once logged in, additional functionality is provided to the user in the form of the ability to save books to a favorites list for future reference.

This project demonstrates the use of recent tech in the form of GraphQL queries and mutations interacting with a modern React front end for a dynamic and seamless user experience. Unfortunately, my biggest challenge was trying to work out a bunch of bugs from a lot of uncompatable versions of software. Since an older version of some of the technologies were used, not all of it played nicely together, and some of the kinks are currently being worked out still.
